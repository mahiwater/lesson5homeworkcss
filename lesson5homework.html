    <h1> pop corn flavors! </h1>
    <hr>
    <p id="ex1"> Classic Movie Theater Butter
    There is an undeniable comfort in the golden, salty crunch of Classic Movie Theater Butter popcorn. This flavor isn’t
    just about the taste; it’s an olfactory experience that immediately evokes the excitement of a darkened cinema. The
    kernels are typically drenched in a rich, buttery topping that seeps into the nooks and crannies of the popped corn,
    finished with a fine dusting of "flavacol" salt. It is the ultimate indulgence for those who believe that when it comes
    to popcorn, more is always better.</p>
    <p id="ex2"> Sharp White Cheddar
    For those who prefer a savory, tangy kick, Sharp White Cheddar offers a more gourmet snacking experience. Unlike the
    neon-orange varieties of the past, white cheddar popcorn focuses on a clean, creamy profile with a slight bite. The fine
    cheese powder clings to the fluffy blossoms of the corn, providing a sophisticated saltiness that feels light yet
    satisfying. It’s the perfect companion for a glass of wine or a casual afternoon snack when you want something a bit
    more elevated than standard salt. </p>
    <p id="ex3"> Salted Caramel Crunch
    When the craving for sweets hits, Salted Caramel popcorn provides the perfect balance of sugar and spice. Each kernel is
    encased in a brittle, glass-like shell of caramelized sugar and butter, creating a satisfying "snap" with every bite.
    The addition of flaky sea salt is crucial here; it cuts through the intense sweetness of the toffee, highlighting the
    deep, toasted notes of the sugar. Often mixed with pecans or drizzled with dark chocolate, this flavor turns a simple
    grain into a decadent dessert.</p>
